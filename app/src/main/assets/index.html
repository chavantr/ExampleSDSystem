<h5>The scenario of cleanliness with respect to garbage management is degrading tremendously. Proper garbage management techniques are very crucial to stop the garbage menace which has spread everywhere especially in cities like Bengaluru,Pune. With this condition of garbage crisis there is a need of applying a method that improves the garbage problems. Therefore we are developing a framework to detect garbage level using IoT based on sensors and Android app. 
This app will help to keep the cities clean. This system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins. The system uses sensor over the bins to detect the garbage level and compare it with the garbage bins depth. The bins are identified with the help of unique IDs. This helps in tracking various bins across the city. Thus this system saves the time of the collectors by allowing them to go to the locations where the garbage has to be cleared rather than going to all the bins.
